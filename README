////////////////////////////
//  DOCUMENTATION
////////////////////////////

1. REQUIREMENTS
- In order to run Supremation, your page must be running jQuery. You also need to include the following line in the <head> tag.

<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery.supremation.min.js"></script>

-----------

2. USAGE

- .supremate(properties,speed,easing,callback)

- The usage for supremate is almost exactly the same as jQuery's .animate method, except for that duration has been replaced with speed. Speed is defined in units of pixels / second.

-----------

3. COMPATIBILITY

- Supremate runs in Firefox 2+, Internet Explorer 5.5+, Safari 3+, Opera 9+, and Chrome 1+.

- It is best to the latest version of jQuery with Supremate.


////////////////////////////
//  FAQ
////////////////////////////

1. What is Supremation?

- Supremation is a jQuery plugin that allows you to determine animation speed (distance/duration) versus strictly duration.

-----------

2. Why would I ever use this?

- Supremation is useful for animating elements that have either a small or large distance to cover. If only using duration, this could either make the animation very slow and very fast. With Supremation, this is not an issue as the duration is calculated for each instance.

Not to mention, minified and gzipped, Supremation is 0.6kb.

-----------

3. What properties does this support?

- Supremation results in making a .animate() call through jQuery, so anything that works with .animate works with Supremation!

-----------

4. Can I help?

Absolutely! Supremation is on Github. https://github.com/lukeshumard/supremation
