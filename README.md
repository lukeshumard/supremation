### Supremation ###

# Demo #
http://lukeshumard.github.io/supremation

# Usage #
`$(selector).supremate(properties,speed,easing,callback);`

The usage for supremate is almost exactly the same as jQuery's .animate method, except for that duration has been replaced with speed. Speed is defined in units of pixels / second.
